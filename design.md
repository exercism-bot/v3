## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the Concept of Type Inference.

## Learning objectives

- Know what type-inference is
- Know how type-inference works
- Know on what values type inference works (including records, tuples and discriminated unions)
- Know about the limitations of type inference and how to work around them
- Know what automatic generalization is
- Know what generic functions are

## Out of scope

- Performance aspects

## Concepts

- `type-inference`: know what type-inference is; know how type-inference works; know on what values type inference works; know about the limitations of type inference and how to work around them; know what automatic generalization is
- `generic-functions`: know what generic functions are

## Prequisites

- `records`: know what records are
- `tuples`: know what tuples are
- `discriminated-unions`: know what discriminated unions are
- `higher-order-functions`: know how to read function type signatures
